# Orchestrator
Provide tracability of learning and predictions.

A RESTful API with Flask (and [Flask-PyMongo](https://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) for the Orchestrator.

Documentation (with endpoints specification) can be found [here!](https://morpheoorg.github.io/morpheo-orchestrator/)

## Getting started

Requirements:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)
- Python3
- If you want: virtualenv and [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

Make sure Python3 and MongoDB are installed.

Clone the repository, create a virtual environment with Python3, and instal pip packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/DeepSeeOrg/orchestrator.git
cd orchestrator
mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 orchestrator
setvirtualenvproject
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Start MongoDB:  
on Linux it is done automatically but you can force it with  
`sudo service mongod start`  
on OSX  
`mongod`

Launch the app: `python api.py`

Interact with the api:
- GET example: `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/problem` 
- POST example: `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/problem -d '{"uuid": "fc896fb1", "workflow": "ac432fx9"}' -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json"`

## Coverage
We use [coverage.py](http://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Run  
`coverage run test_api.py`  
`coverage report -m api.py`  
Without `-m api.py` the coverage report goes to irrelevant depth. We can specify the files to be reported on with `-m file1 file2 ...`
